# Overview

Panjia is the main setting of the game "JRPG"(subject to change). Panjia was named after the ==God of Land==, [[Panjia (Deity)|Panjia]] by [[Junii]] scholars in 37 APS. The planet was once referred to as ==Earth==, which is ancient [[Terran]] that translates roughly to ==the essence of land==. Panjia is the location of a number of different countries, all sharing the same continent named Farwield. Farwield is home to Twelve fully formed countries, of which four are run by Terran government, six are run by Junii and are part of the [[Serai Counsel]], and of the remaining two, one is a country that technically belongs to Terrans but has been given the [[Azanti]] to solidify bonds between them, and the last belongs to a rogue faction of [[Zeratta]] that have given up their nomadic lifestyles and settled into a form of stability, although their country's borders are frequently disputed by neighboring factions, most agree that it is better to let sleeping dogs lie as far as Zeratta claims to territory go. 

# History
## 37,046 BPS-100 APS: The polar shift and the great fall

Panjia has existed since far before Terrans ever trod the earth, known to have been called home by many races thought now to be extinct, such as the fearful and inexplicably bird-like Saurians, but was mostly inhabited by Terrans by the year 37,046 BPS, though it is speculated that due to the fact Terrans were the only sentient race, the scholars of the old world are more than likely mistaken on this fact. Through the years before the anomalous shift in polarity that was known for revealing the existence of Gods and demons, Terrans lived in prosperity, and even managed to make advancements in a particular type of technology, known as Electromancy. After the shift, however, Terrans experienced a period known as [[The Great Fall]], where many a Terran died as they discovered that the electricity they had so deftly harnessed would no longer work as they had been using it. After this realization the Terrans experienced a sort of dark age, and in the scramble to understand what was going on, the Junii managed to adapt faster and begun to inhabit the strange ruined cities the humans seemed to not find as adequate lodgings, and Junii quickly became a dominant species, a title they haven't relinquished, even with the emergence of Azanti and Zeratta(Azanti because of their kind nature and desire to teach the humans about how to survive in a post-calamity world, and Zeratta due to lack of interest in their standing with other races.). Panjia was renamed by the Junii, who were unaware of the Terrans' former name for the planet, in the year 37 APS by Junii scholar Mues the Wise, naming the planet after the Junii god of land and soil. by the year 100, two major nations had been formed: The empire of Padua, formed by the Terran Emperor Leto IV, and the republic of Dorishva founded by the general Alfred Skullkaith.
